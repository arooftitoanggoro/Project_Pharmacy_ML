The pharmaceutical industry in Indonesia is a rapidly growing market with a vast array of medicines available for distribution through channels such as retail pharmacies and hospitals. With the diverse geography of Indonesia, featuring unique characteristics across different regions, this presents a challenging yet exciting opportunity to analyze the sales of these medicines. In this paper, we aim to predict the potential profit of each medicine sold in Indonesia by considering various factors such as the distribution channels and regional differences. Our approach to this analysis is through the use of machine learning techniques, specifically decision tree and random forest algorithms.

The decision tree algorithm is a supervised learning method that breaks down a dataset into smaller and smaller subsets while an associated decision tree is incrementally developed. The end result is a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, and it can be used for classification and regression tasks. The random forest algorithm, on the other hand, is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to create a more robust model.

By comparing the results obtained from using these two machine learning methods, we hope to gain deeper insights into the factors that influence the profit potential of each medicine sold in Indonesia. Furthermore, by providing a comprehensive analysis, we aim to contribute to the growth of the pharmaceutical industry in Indonesia and provide valuable information for stakeholders in the market.
